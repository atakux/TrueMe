*TrueMe* is a finalist project in the [2024 ECS Student Project Innovation Expo Competition](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/innovation-expo/)!

# Description
*TrueMe* aims to assist users in their skincare and beauty journey. Users will be able to easily discover new products that are recommended to them based on their skin condition. *TrueMe* will utilize facial recognition to achieve this. In addition, the user will have control over their automated suggestions with filters in order to further provide personalization. *TrueMe* will also allow users to create their own daily routines as well as receive recommended routines.
